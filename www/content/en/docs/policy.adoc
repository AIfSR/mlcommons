== Overview

The Science WG will have training and inference benchmarks. Here we
specify the rules for training submissions.

The Science WG will have Closed and Open divisions and submissions to
these divisions must be separate although the same activity could
qualify for both. The Open division is expected to be the primary
focus.

A Closed division submission should report system performance as the
result and give the logging information outlined in MLPerf HPC
Rules. The stopping criterion will be the value of loss specified in
the benchmark. Power measurements may also be supplied.

An Open division submission aims to improve scientific discovery from
the dataset specified in the benchmark which will specify one or more
scientific measurements to be calculated in the submission. The result
will be the value of these specified measurements from the submitted
model. This model can be based on the supplied reference model or
distinct. Data augmentation is allowed and all hyperparameters
can be changed in the reference model if used. The result should be a
GitHub (markdown) document starting with a table listing *Measurement
name*, *Reference model value*, *Submitted model value*. For benchmarks
with more than one measurement, an average difference between submitted
and reference measurements should be given. Power and
performance values are optional but encouraged in the results
document. The resulting document should give enough details on the
submitted model and any data augmentation so that the review team can
evaluate its scientific soundness. Citations should be included to
describe the scientific basis of the approach. Other rules for the
Open division are as described in MLCommons® Training Rules (HPC has
no special rules for the Open division).



All rules are taken from the
https://github.com/mlcommons/training_policies/blob/master/training_rules.adoc[MLPerf
Training Rules] except for those that are overridden here.

The MLPerf and https://mlcommons.org[MLCommons®] name and logo are
trademarks. In order to refer to a result using the MLPerf and
MLCommons® name, the result must conform to the letter and spirit of
the rules specified in this document. The MLCommons® organization
reserves the right to solely determine if a use of its name or logo is
acceptable.

== Benchmarks

The benchmark suite consists of the benchmarks shown in the following
table.

|===
|Problem |Dataset |Quality Target
| Earthquake Prediction |Earthquake data from USGS. | Normalized Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency (NNSE), `0.8<NNSE<0.99`, Details can be found in [3].
| CloudMask | Multispectral image data from Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument. | convergence target `0.9`
| STEMDL Classification | Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED) patterns. | The scientific metric for this problem is the top1 classification accuracy and F1-score (the higher the better). The main challenge is to predict 3D geometry from its 3 projections (2D images). Information about the best accuracy so far for this dataset can be found in [4]
| UNO |Molecular features of tumor cells across multiple data sources. | Score: `0.0054`
|===

== Divisions

There are two divisions of the Science Benchmark Suite, the Closed
division and the Open division.

=== Closed Division

The Closed division requires using the same preprocessing, model, and
training method as the reference implementation.

The closed division models are:

|===


== Data Set

=== Data State at Start of Run

Each reference implementation includes a download script or broadly
available method to acquire and verify the dataset.

The data at the start of the benchmark run should reside on a parallel
file system that is persistent (>= 1 month, not subject to eviction by
other users), can be downloaded to / accessed by the user, and can be
shared among users at the facility. Any staging to node-local disk or
memory or system burst buffer should be included in the benchmark time
measurement.

You must flush/reset the on-node caches prior to running each instance
of the benchmark. Due to practicality issues, you are not required to
reset off-node system-level caches.

We otherwise follow the training rule
https://github.com/mlcommons/training_policies/blob/master/training_rules.adoc#6-data-set[Data State at
Start of Run] on consistency with the reference implementation
preprocessing and allowance for reformatting.

== Training Loop

=== Hyperparameters and Optimizer

==== OPEN

Hyperparameters and optimizers may be freely changed.

==== CLOSED

Allowed hyperparameter and optimizer settings are specified here. For
anything not explicitly mentioned here, submissions must match the
behavior and settings of the reference implementations.

In order to simplify the complex setup for scientific benchmarks,
we require that all parameters are included in the config file when available.
We recommend a YAML format for the config file.

== Run Results

MLCommon® Science Benchmark Suite submissions consist of the following
two metrics: metrics 1 is considered mandatory for a complete
submission whereas metric 2 is considered optional:

=== Strong Scaling (Time to Convergence)

This is a *mandatory* metric: see MLPerf Training
https://github.com/mlcommons/training_policies/blob/master/training_rules.adoc#section-run-results[Run Results] for
reference. The same rules apply here.

=== Weak Scaling (Throughput)

At this time we are not considering weak scaling.

== Benchmark Results

We follow MLPerf Training
Benchmark Results rule
along with the following required number of runs per benchmark.  Note
that since run-to-run variability is already captured by spatial
multiplexing in case of metric 3, we use the adjusted requirement that
the number of trained instances has to be at least equal to the number
of runs for metric 1 and 2.

The numbers given below reflect the minimum number of repetitive runs
required to produce repeatable metrics.
In case of the Earthquake benchmark, we have reduced the number of runs to 1 for metric 1, as the runs take a long time (between 5 - 12h on NVidia GPUs).

|===
| |Number of Runs |Number of Runs |Number of Runs
|Benchmark | Metric 1 |  Metric 2 | Metric 3
|Earthquake | 1 | 5 | >=5
|CloudMask | 10 | 10 | >=10
|STEMDL Classification | 5 | 5 | >=5
|CANDLE UNO | 5 | 5 | >=5
|===

== Identifying Information

To identify a benchmark user must add the following information at the beginning of the submission (We use here an example for the Earthquake Benchmark:

  name: Earthquake
  user: Gregor von Laszewski
  e-mail: laszewski@gmail.com
  organisation:  University of Virginia
  division: BII
  status: submission
  platform: rivanna shared memory

This can easily be achieved through a configuration file and inclusion into the benchmark with the mlcommons logging library.



== Contributing

We expect that over time additional benchmarks will be contributed. At this time we have adopted the following best practice for the contribution workflow

1. The initial benchmark is hosted on a group accessible GitHub repository, where members have full access rights. These may be different repositories. Currently, we have one repository at https://github.com/laszewsk/mlcommons[[10]].
2. New version will first be made available in that group repository while using branching.
3. A new candidate version is created and merged into main.
4. The candidate version is internally tested by the group members to evaluate expected behavior.
5. Once passed, the code is uploaded to the  https://github.com/mlcommons/science[MLCommons® Science GitHub Repository [9]].
6. Announcements are made to solicit submissions.
7. Submissions are checked and integrated according to the MLCommons® rules and policies.

== Logging Libraries

Augmentation of codes for consideration into the inclusion of the science benchmarks must use the

* https://github.com/mlcommons/logging[MLCommons® Logging Library]

An alternative library that internally produces MLCommons® events for logging  is the

* https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-common/blob/main/cloudmesh/common/StopWatch.py[StopWatch] from https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-common[cloudmesh-common]
* https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-common/blob/main/README-mlcommons.md[Quickstart for using Cloudmesh StopWatch for MLcommons]

This library has the advantage of generating a human-readable summary table in addition to the MLCommons® log events.
