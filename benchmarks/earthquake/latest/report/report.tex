\section{Setup}

The code is relatively easy to setup for use on various computers
using NVIDIA Cards.  The code has been run on A100, V100, K100, P100,
and RTX3090. Other cards may be also supported, but the code requires
a fair amount of memory. Therfor it may not be able to be run on
NVIDIA Cards with less the 24GB of memory.

The documentation on ho to set up the code is available as part of a
\href{README.md}{???} file \cite{???}. 


\section{Cloudmesh}

The code has been enhanced with benchmark fuctions from Cloudmesh
\cite{}. It also uses a convenient extension to batch scripts called
cloudmesh-sbatch allowing more easily to place additional templated
parameters into the SBATCH or LSF shell script parameters when
supmitting to bath systems. In addition we have developed a cloudmesn
compute cluster workflow management tool that allows us to submit the
codes in parallel to multiple supercomputers as well as parallel batch
jobs \cite{las-cc,las21openapi}
